            There are two main reasons why you need a Privacy Policy:

          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2">They're legally required</h4>
          <P widthFull={100} marginTop={10} fontSize={10}>
            If you collect or use personal information, you'll have to comply
            with privacy laws put in place around the world to protect consumer
            privacy. These laws will apply regardless of where your business
            itself is located, as they work to protect consumers in specific
            regions. For example, if your business is located in the U.S. but
            you have users in the EU, the EU's GDPR will still apply to you.
          </P>
          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-2">Consumers expect to see them</h4>
          <P widthFull={100} marginTop={10} fontSize={10}>
            In a world where consumer privacy is more important than ever and
            consumers are starting to take their privacy more seriously, not
            having a Privacy Policy can mean you may lose customers. People
            expect to see a Privacy Policy that they can easily access whenever
            they want. Not having one will make you seem untrustworthy.
